<p class="pubsource"><a href="http://techforum.booknetcanada.ca/ebookcraft/" target="_blank">EbookCraft 2019</a></p>
<p class="pubdate">Toronto, Canada, March 19, 2019</p>
<p class="desc">Publishers and book-makers are still looking for ways to make more books, faster, while maintaining the quality that readers expect from professional products. More and more publishers are exploring ways to add automation to their workflows, and looking for tools that can replace or at least speed up the traditional InDesign workflow. Unfortunately, today's standard automation tools can't match the page quality that InDesign offers (at least not without tedious time-investment). At the same time, e-reading systems continue to vary widely in their support of standard Web design elements, which makes it difficult to create digital book products that can rival their print counterparts. Both of these reasons explain the continued interest in finding browser-based pagination solutions â€” as page-layout alternatives and as browser-based reading systems. In this session, we explained the problems that publishers are facing, and how web-based pagination can offer a solution to those problems. We also went over some of the tools available today and those in development, a few case studies, and some of the theoretical concepts behind browser-based pagination.</p>

<p class="desc">In this 3-hour tutorial, we introduced designers to the concepts of HTML and CSS, with the goal of building an nderstanding of these core web design languages to help designers collaborate more effectively with coding teams or even design directly in digital formats. We walked through the basics of HTML and CSS, and how these two technologies go hand-in-hand to style and compose  content, giving attendees a solid understanding of the fundamentals of these core web design technologies and the confidence to edit HTML and CSS documents or even to create them from scratch. Topics covered: The basics: opening and editing HTML and CSS files; Anatomy of HTML tags and documents; Including graphics and other media; Exporting HTML from InDesign; Anatomy of CSS rules; How to apply CSS styles to different parts of an HTML document; Understanding the cascade; Working with fonts; Next-level CSS: animations, transformations, and print media; Out-of-the-box web design frameworks.

<p class="desc">Automating ebook production can seem daunting, but there are a lot of tools already out there that can help you along. If you don't try to build a rigid, everlasting, and unbreakable automated toolchain, but instead think about the points of change and build around them, then the task of automating becomes much less scary. Get a first-hand look at a successful case study and get some practical guidance for building functions that work smoothly and meet user needs.</p>

<p class="desc">People like to read things on the Internet, but does that include books? For many years, publishing and the Web have been converging. Devices like Amazon's Kindle and Apple's iPad have helped to popularize ebooks as a legitimate reading format, but digital publishing is ready to level-up from its awkward adolescence and the Internet is the hormone injection we need to make that happen. Of course, there are challenges involved in publishing books on the Web, from both a technical and design standpoint. In this talk, Nellie looks at modern print book and ebook production workflows, the technology that drives book-making automation, the current state of ebook reading and design, and where we're heading for the future.</p>
